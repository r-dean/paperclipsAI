# Usage

Learn about how RL can be applied by walking through these Jupyter notebooks

## 1. Bandits - To clip or not to clip

[This notebook](./playground/1-bandits.ipynb) shows how the simpliest RL framework (bandits) can be applied to
learn whether pressing the 'make paperclip' button aids the agent in its goal.

## 2. Linear Functions - Buying wire

[This notebook](./playground/2-linear-functions.ipynb) introduces an agent which takes into account the current state and approximates the value of each action based on a linear function.
